# 🧪 QA Automation Portfolio — Selenium + Python

This project contains a collection of automated tests built for the **QABrains** website.
The goal is to demonstrate my ability to design and implement a structured, maintainable, and scalable web automation suite.

The tests are written using:
- Python
- Selenium WebDriver
- Pytest
- Page Object Model (POM)
- Explicit Waits
- Logging
